# Inventory Control Database

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a SQL-based inventory control management system using Walmart sales data from 2009-2014. The objective is to create an efficient inventory management system and perform data analysis to extract valuable business insights.

## Dataset Information
The dataset comprises:
- Walmart store sales data
- Macroeconomic parameters (GDP, CPI, cotton production, unemployment rate)
- Weather data
- Holiday data

The competition on Kaggle that prompted the need for this inventory control database is over, so you can no longer download the data. However, this project presents a proposed solution for the problem.

## Features
- **Database Connection:** Establishes a connection to an SQLite database to store and manage the data.
- **Data Loading:** Loads data from CSV files into Pandas DataFrames for preprocessing.
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Cleans the data by handling missing values and ensuring proper data types.
- **Database Schema Creation:** Defines the schema for the database tables and creates them in the SQLite database.
- **Data Insertion:** Inserts cleaned data into the respective database tables.
- **Data Analysis and Queries:** Performs SQL queries to analyze sales data, weather conditions, holiday seasons, and macroeconomic variables.
- **Data Visualization:** Visualizes the results of the analysis using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Proposed Solution
- **Identify Trends:** Determine the year with the highest sales and analyze the factors contributing to it.
- **Weather Impact Analysis:** Assess how weather conditions affect sales performance.
- **Holiday Season Analysis:** Investigate sales trends during holiday seasons.
- **Macroeconomic Analysis:** Explore the relationships between sales and macroeconomic variables such as GDP, CPI, cotton production, and unemployment rate.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** For data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
- **Pandas:** For data loading, cleaning, and manipulation.
- **SQLite:** For creating and managing the database.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.
- **SQL:** For performing queries and data analysis.

## Usage
1. **Database Setup:** Ensure SQLite is installed and create a database connection.
2. **Data Loading:** Load the sales, macroeconomic, weather, and holiday data into Pandas DataFrames.
3. **Data Cleaning:** Clean the data to handle missing values and ensure consistency.
4. **Schema Creation:** Define and create the database schema.
5. **Data Insertion:** Insert the cleaned data into the database.
6. **Perform Analysis:** Execute SQL queries to analyze the data.
7. **Visualize Results:** Generate visualizations to present the insights derived from the data.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how a SQL-based inventory control management system can be developed and used to derive valuable business insights from historical sales data. Despite the competition on Kaggle being over and the dataset no longer available for download, this project provides a comprehensive solution to the problem.
