# Inventory-Control-DB
SQL-based inventory control management system using Walmart sales data for analysis and insights.

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a SQL-based inventory control management system using Walmart sales data from 2009-2014. The objective is to create an efficient inventory management system and perform data analysis to extract valuable business insights.

## Dataset Information
The dataset comprises:

- Walmart store sales data
- Macroeconomic parameters (GDP, CPI, cotton production, unemployment rate)
- Weather data
- Holiday data

The competition on Kaggle that prompted the need for this inventory control database is over, so you can no longer download the data. However, this project presents a proposed solution for the problem.
